This plugin shows the daily updated Rank Risk Index by Rank Ranger

== Description ==

Built by www.thewebmaster.com this plugin shows the daily updated Rank Risk Index by Rank Ranger.  It shows the SERP fluctuations for over 10,000 domains and keywords to give a fairly accurate account of when Google's serps change.  This will enable you to address negative results quickly.

The plugin will add the Rank Risk chart to your admin dashboard.  In addition, it will add a widget (although this is quite wide, so may not fit in a sidebar).  Thirdly, it creates a shortcode so you can insert the Rank Risk chart into any page or post by using the shortcode "[rankrisk]".
